        Readbo is an online application that is a news aggregator.<br/>
        You can compare it to the well-known <a href="http://reader.google.com" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, but it also aggregates social networks like Twitter and Facebook.<br/>

    <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Why would I need to use Readbo ?</h4>
    <p>
        Readbo allows you to see a lot of information from websites all over the internet. It tracks the news you haven't yet seen, and displays them to you. This allows you to spend a lot less time looking for blogs.<br/><br/>
        The main use of it is to save you as much time as it can. Then you can spend more time with your family, or go play Counter-Strike.

    <h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Why is it better than any other news reader ?</h4>
    <p>
        1) You can filter the content that is displayed to you. Hate LOL-Cats ? Hide every subject that contains the word "cat".<br/><br/>
        2) Facebook and Twitter (soon Google+) can also be added to the application. Never miss a useful status or tweet again.<br/><br/>
        3) We want to bring something new to the table, that will actually help you, not just create another RSS reader..
