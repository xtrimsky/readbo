Newsfeed app written back in 2011 by Andrei Pervychine. I am open sourcing it now because I won't have use of this code in the future. The main advantage it had compared to Google Reader was that it could also include Facebook and Twitter. It was very useful to have all the possible news in one single app.

#### Reason of shut down

Back then servers were more expensive, it costed me 80$/month to run this. After running it for a year, I decided to shut down as my daughter was about to be born and I knew I wouldn't have much time to improve it and minimize the costs. I could now probably run it on a couple small VPSes totaling 12$ / month and it would be much faster.

#### Needed improvement

Separate the web app, and the news fetching service. The main problem with this version was that it could not easily be splitted into many servers. I've worked on a new version but I am not sharing it as it's not a working prototype and I'll never finish it.
